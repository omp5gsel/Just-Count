# Just-Count
A simple, online game, where all that you need to do is **match cards and count!**

## Overview for site requirements

This site is intended to give entertainment to players by using memory and timers to create quick competative gameplay. The site aims to provide the following mechincs & features:

-   Card matching
-   Numberical card order logic
-   Session timer and score
-   User friendly interactive tutorial

## Development Process

### 1. Planning
I started by creating wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile versions of the website using Balsamiq. These are included in the `/assets/images/readme/wireframes/` folder. The purpose of this is to give me chance to see how the site would be layed out, and how this needs to be created in order to be compatible, responsive, and most importantly, playable, on a wide range of devices.

### 2. Building the Site
The site will only require one page. This is because the plan is for the site to be easy to follow from the second the page is loaded and only the required content shows at the correct points of the users experience. For this, I will utilise HTML libraries such as bootstrap for a responsive and quick layout, CSS for custom aespethics, JavaScript libraries such as JQuery for interactivity and animation and Font-Awesome for icons.

### 3. Testing
I will test the site manually on multiple browsers and devices. I will use W3C validators and Lighthouse for performance and accessibility. Details are in the Testing section.

### 4. Deployment
The site is deployed to Github & Github Pages.
